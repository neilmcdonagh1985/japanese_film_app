A Vue/Javascript app which displays information about Ghibli films. This combined practice with Vue in the front-end with sourcing an API with a 'fetch' statement. Components were divided into film list, film item, film detail and films to watch later. This project was a breakthrough in my consolidation of Vue features such as eventBus, props, component rendering, as well as valuable practice in understanding of the information flow of such applications and how API data is accessed and displayed on the front-end.
